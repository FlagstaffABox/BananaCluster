MPICH running on a stack of Banana Pi boards - currently just an image and a few scripts

Contained in this folder are three main files, the disc image, the furthest I have gotten with a script,
and a simple tutorial to explain how to set up a new card from the disc image. For this you will need
Win32DiscImager and SDFormatter. These softwares will allow you to clean a card and write the image onto
it. From there, simply follow the steps listed in the tutorial.

The script is in a testing stage, at an estimated 90% completion. It needs some work, but using the steps
combined in both the tutorial and the script, you may be able to get a working card.

Further documentation and necessary links will be added to this file as needed.
